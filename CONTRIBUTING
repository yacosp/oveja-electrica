thanks for taking an interest in this crazy project!

this is an experimental idea. it will probably require some fiddling with stuff
i don't even remember about in order to make any sense. you can contact me for
assistance, questions or ideas to share at yaco@yaco.net.

if you have an idea for enhancements or features, you can use the meta-project
issue tracker at github: https://github.com/yacosp/oveja-electrica/issues. you
can also send me an email to yaco@yaco.net, will try to reply as soon as
possible.

if you have new crazy ideas related to this, i would really appreciate knowing
about them... may even find time to lend a hand!
